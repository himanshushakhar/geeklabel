# Bootstrap based Drupal subtheme

Below are instructions on how to setup this sub-theme using a Less
preprocessor.

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Additional Setup](#setup)

## Prerequisites
- You must understand the basic concept of using the [Less] CSS pre-processor.
- You must use a **[local Less compiler](https://www.google.com/search?q=less+compiler)**.
- You must use the [Bootstrap Framework Source Files] ending in the `.less`
  extension, not files ending in `.css`.

## Additional Setup {#setup}
Download and extract the **latest** 3.x.x version of
[Bootstrap Framework Source Files] into this theme. After it has been
extracted, the folder should read `./geeklabel/bootstrap`.
